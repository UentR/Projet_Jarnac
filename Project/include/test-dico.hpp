 * This function creates three instances of the ForDict class and initializes
 * them with the same dictionary file. It then generates a random word from the
 * dictionary and measures the time it takes to find the word in each
 * dictionary. Finally, it also measures the time it takes to linearly search
 * for the word in the first dictionary. The process continues indefinitely.
